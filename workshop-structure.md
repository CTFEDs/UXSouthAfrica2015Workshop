# Workshop Structure

An Work-In-Progress document for the structure of the workshop.
This is a list of ideas, not a list of [All The Things](http://i.imgur.com/6ILXd4r.jpg) we will do.

Idea for general flow:

* attendees form smallish groups at tables;
* each table makes a list of patterns;
* each person picks a pattern and works through improving it;
* each person presents to the table.

## Basic shape

1. What are Future Friendly principles and why should you care?
* What are some common patterns and are they Future Friendly?
* For the patterns that aren't, how can we make them Future Friendly?

## Things to keep in mind

We salute [Sharon Bowman](http://bowperson.com/)'s [Training From The Back Of The Room](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn-ebook/dp/B0062O7L7S/)

Behaviour + Concept / Skill = Learning Outcome

1. **Movement** trumps splitting
* **Talking** trumps listening
* **Images** trump words
* **Writing** trumps reading
* **Shorter** trumps longer
* **Different** trumps same

More things to remember:

* Primacy-Recency principle
* Content; activity; materials
* Provide graphic organisers
* Individual accountability
* Table demos and presentations. Less pressure, more trust.
* Collaboration over competition.
* ROI

## Connections

* To existing knowledge
  * Make UX principles list
* To learning goals
  * Fix your specific stuff
  * Principles to apply

### Warm-up

* Web / app hunt
  * Pick one pattern you love, and one you hate. Explain why.
* Survey
  * Ask people one pattern they hate, one they love.

### Fast Pass

* Turn and talk
  * Introduce yourself, why you're here, what you want learn.
* Take a guess
  * List of user device, connection, disability assumptions. Compare.

### Start-ups

* Wall Writing
  * Chart per pattern, write pros and cons.
  * Chart per pattern, principle
* Table talk
  * Pattern per table. Discuss, present.
  * Many patterns per table. One each or per pair, then present.
* Card carousels
  * Card with pattern on. Pass along. 1 pro, 1 con, 1 fix.

## Concepts

### Interactive Lecture Strategies

* Stand, stretch, speak
  * What you've learned so far

### Jigsaw

* Concept clinic
  * Each table writes. Passes right. Each table writes. Once the original is back at the table, the table writes a summary.

### Teach-back

* Pair Teach-back
  * Explain / demo your solution.

## Conclusions

### Learner-led summaries

* Learning logs
  * Summary, most important items
* Card exchange
  * Swap email and action plans
* Round robins
  * One pattern on a card. Pass right, write improvement. Once they're all done, write a summary. Group discussion.

### Evaluation strategies

* Where do you stand?
  * Pair up. Discuss how to get to the next step.

### Celebrations

* Circle Celebrations
  * Ball toss. What did you enjoy? What will you use?
