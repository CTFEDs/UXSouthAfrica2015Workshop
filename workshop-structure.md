Problems, Patterns, Principles, Solutions.

## Connections

* Identify your specific **Problems** and **Patterns**.
* Make your own list of Future Friendly UX **Principles**.
* Start sketching out **Solutions**.

## Warm up

* What was the first thing you worked on?
* What are we doing now that will need updating soon?

## Arriving

* **Turn and talk**: share your warm up answers. Write down other people's answers on sticky notes and take them back to your table.

## 1pm

* **Table talk**: on big bits of paper, write down changes in the tech landscape in the past few years. Guidelines will be up on the wall, to be revealed later.
* **Presentation**: Future Friendly User Experience.
  * About 15 minutes.

## Break

* **Discussion**: What's the most important Future Friendly principle?

## 2pm

* **Gallery Walk**: walk around the room and write on the posters (each one has some samples).
  * Problems and patterns from the Table Talk.
  * Future Friendly principles from Presentation.
* **Summarise**: make summaries of the posters for your table. One person at your table will present to the room: your table's favourite thing from each poster.

## Break

* **Pair Teach-back**: find a partner and ask them one thing they learned so far. Write your partner's answer on a sticky note and put it on the Pair Teach-back poster.

## 3pm-ish

### Sketch your Future Friendly UX Solutions

### Diverge

* Pick a pattern and, on your own, write down lots of ideas. Focus on **quantity** rather than **quality**.

## Break

## 4pm

### Converge

* **Dote Vote**. Grab a pen and stand up.
  * Move one seat to your left.
  * Add a dot on your favourite idea.
  * Repeat until you're back at your own seat.
* **Table shout out**. Tell the room one about your pattern, and the solution with the most votes. Use one sentence for each.
* What **Future Friendly Principles** are you using?

## Leaving

* **Card Exchange: SMART goal**: find a buddy. On the front of a card, write down a SMART goal. On the back of it, write down your contact details. Swap your card with your buddy's.
* **Most Import Thing**: on the poster by the door, write down the most import thing you learned today.
* **Handout**: pick up a copy of the Problems, Patterns, Principles, Solutions handout on your way out.
