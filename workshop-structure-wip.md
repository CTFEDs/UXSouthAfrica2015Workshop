# Workshop Structure

An Work-In-Progress document for the structure of the workshop.
This is a list of ideas, not a list of [All The Things](http://i.imgur.com/6ILXd4r.jpg) we will do.

Idea for general flow:

* attendees form smallish groups at tables;
* each table makes a list of patterns;
* each person picks a pattern and works through improving it;
* each person presents to the table.

## Basic shape

1. What are Future Friendly principles and why should you care?
* What are some common patterns and are they Future Friendly?
* For the patterns that aren't, how can we make them Future Friendly?

## Things to keep in mind

We salute [Sharon Bowman](http://bowperson.com/)'s [Training From The Back Of The Room](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn-ebook/dp/B0062O7L7S/)

Behaviour + Concept / Skill = Learning Outcome

1. **Movement** trumps splitting
* **Talking** trumps listening
* **Images** trump words
* **Writing** trumps reading
* **Shorter** trumps longer
* **Different** trumps same

More things to remember:

* Primacy-Recency principle
* Content; activity; materials
* Provide graphic organisers
* Individual accountability
* Table demos and presentations. Less pressure, more trust.
* Collaboration over competition.
* ROI
