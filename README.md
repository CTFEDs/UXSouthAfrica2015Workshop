# UXSouthAfrica2015Workshop

> Gathering some ideas for a workshop at UX South Africa 2015.

The big idea: look at improving some common design patterns that are usually implemented in a way that isn't very friendly to Progressive Enhancement or Front-end Performance.

One of the reasons to do a workshop rather than a talk is to get more face-to-face time with the presenter(s). We think about 15 people feels right for a 4 hour workshop to make sure that everyone gets some attention.

## Title

Future Friendly UX design

## Describe your talk in approximately 300 characters

We'll look at some common design patterns, what's not so great about them, and what we can do to make them better for our users. We'll be discussing improvements we can make, sketching them out, and learning about what online tools we can use to help us.

## Why is this a good topic?

Attendees will leave with practical tips and techniques for making their designs more Future (and User) Friendly.

## Any comments, questions or requirements?

We'll need a projector, and lots of pen, paper, and sticky notes. Please!
