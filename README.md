# UXSouthAfrica2015Workshop

> Gathering some ideas for a workshop at UX South Africa 2015.

The big idea: look at improving some common design patterns that are usually implemented in a way that isn't very friendly to Progressive Enhancement or Front-end Performance.

One of the reasons to do a workshop rather than a talk is to get more face-to-face time with the presenter(s). We think about 15 people feels right for a 4 hour workshop to make sure that everyone gets some attention.

## Template for gathering ideas
