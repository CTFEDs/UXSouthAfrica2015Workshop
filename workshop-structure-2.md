## Warm up

* What was the first thing you worked on?

## 1pm

* **Table talk**: on big bits of paper, write down changes in the tech landscape in the past few years. Guidelines will be up on the wall, to be revealed later. Examples:

  * quantity of devices;
  * range of screen sizes;
  * diversity of operating system and browser diversity;
  * number of people using the web;

## 3pm-ish

## Leaving

* **Card Exchange: SMART goal**: find a buddy. On the front of a card, write down a SMART goal. On the back of it, write down your contact details. Swap your card with your buddy's.
* **Most Import Thing**: on the poster by the door, write down the most import thing you learned today.
